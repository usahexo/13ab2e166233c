            <h1 id="Hollywood-Casino’s-legal-team-releases-statement-denying-all-charges"><a href="#Hollywood-Casino’s-legal-team-releases-statement-denying-all-charges" class="headerlink" title="Hollywood Casino’s legal team releases statement denying all charges"></a>Hollywood Casino’s legal team releases statement denying all charges</h1><p>In a statement released to the press, Hollywood Casino’s legal team has denied any and all charges filed by the state of Missouri. The casino’s legal team asserts that the state has failed to produce any evidence that Hollywood Casino has engaged in any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“The state has presented no evidence that Hollywood Casino has done anything wrong,” said attorney Neil Kammerman in the statement. “We are confident that when all of the evidence is revealed, it will show that Hollywood Casino has acted lawfully at all times.”</p>
<p>The charges against Hollywood Casino come as part of an ongoing probe into illegal gambling in Missouri. In March, law enforcement officials raided several casinos in the state, including Hollywood Casino, as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino’s legal team says it is cooperating with the investigation but denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<h1 id="Prosecutor-presents-evidence-against-Hollywood-Casino"><a href="#Prosecutor-presents-evidence-against-Hollywood-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Prosecutor presents evidence against Hollywood Casino"></a>Prosecutor presents evidence against Hollywood Casino</h1><p>The prosecutor in the case against Hollywood Casino presented his evidence today. He argued that the casino should be held responsible for the deaths of three people who died of heart attacks after playing at the casino.</p>
<p>The prosecutor pointed to the fact that the casino had put in place policies that encouraged people to play for long periods of time. He also argued that the casino had not done enough to warn players about the risks of playing for extended periods.</p>
<p>Finally, he argued that the casino should have been aware of the health risks associated with playing at the casino and should have done more to protect players.</p>
<h1 id="Defense-argues-that-casino-was-following-state-law"><a href="#Defense-argues-that-casino-was-following-state-law" class="headerlink" title="Defense argues that casino was following state law"></a>Defense argues that casino was following state law</h1><p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - The defense in the trial of two casino executives accused of being accessory to murder argued Monday that the casinos were following state law in dealing with problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Attorney Richard Schonfeld said that executives at the Rio and Palms casinos were acting within the law when they sought help for Vincent “Vinny” Favola, a problem gambler who was later killed.</p>
<p>“The state has safety regulations to protect people like Mr. Favola, and the casinos were complying with those regulations,” Schonfeld said during his opening statement.</p>
<p>Schonfeld said casino executives contacted Favola’s family and friends in an attempt to get him help and that they even offered to pay for him to enter a treatment facility. He also said that casino security officers had no contact with Favola on the night he was killed.</p>
<p>Favola, 50, was shot to death in December 2011 outside his home in Henderson after being followed by two men who had been discharged from the casino’s self-exclusion list. Favola’s widow, Cynthia, is one of the plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<p>The defense is expected to call several witnesses, including Favola’s mother, during the trial, which is expected to last six weeks.</p>

The unanimous verdict was delivered by a jury on Wednesday.</p>
<p>74-year-old Barbara Stevens died after she collapsed in the casino in February 2016. Her family sued the casino, alleging that it failed to provide adequate medical care.</p>
<p>During the trial, the casino argued that Stevens had a history of heart problems and that her death was due to natural causes. However, the jury didn’t believe them and ruled in favor of the Stevens family.</p>
<p>In a statement, attorneys for the family said they were “very pleased with the jury’s verdict.”</p>
<p>“This was a tragic event that could have been prevented if Hollywood Casino had followed their own safety policies and procedures,” they said.</p>
<p>The Stevens family is seeking unspecified damages from the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Hollywood-Casino-fined-in-landmark-online-casino-case"><a href="#Hollywood-Casino-fined-in-landmark-online-casino-case" class="headerlink" title="Hollywood Casino fined in landmark online casino case"></a>Hollywood Casino fined in landmark online casino case</h1><p>The Hollywood Casino in Pennsylvania was fined $8 million for offering illegal online casino games, in what is being seen as a landmark case.</p>
<p>The fine is the largest ever levied by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), and comes after a two-year investigation into Hollywood Casino’s activities.</p>
<p>It is illegal to offer online casino games in the state of Pennsylvania, and the PGCB says that Hollywood Casino violated this law “repeatedly and extensively”.</p>
<p>In a statement, PGCB Chairwoman Sylvester Johnson said that the board was “committed to ensuring that all gaming in Pennsylvania takes place within a safe and regulated environment”.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino has said that it intends to appeal the fine.</p>
