<p>The woman, who is identified only as Jane Doe in court documents, alleged that the dealer made repeated and unwanted advances towards her, even following her when she left the casino.</p>
<p>Doe claimed that the constant attention made her feel uncomfortable and endangered, and that the casino failed to provide a safe working environment.</p>
<p>The jury agreed, awarding Doe $1.5 million in damages for emotional distress and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a series of high-profile sexual harassment lawsuits against casinos. In October last year, a cocktail waitress won $100,000 in damages from a Las Vegas casino after being sexually assaulted by a security guard.</p>
<p>Casinos have long been known for their shady dealings and laissez faire attitude towards employee safety, but it seems that these days they are finally being held accountable for their actions.</p>
<h1 id="Man-banned-from-all-Dutch-casinos-after-hitting-on-blackjack-dealer"><a href="#Man-banned-from-all-Dutch-casinos-after-hitting-on-blackjack-dealer" class="headerlink" title="Man banned from all Dutch casinos after hitting on blackjack dealer"></a>Man banned from all Dutch casinos after hitting on blackjack dealer</h1><p>A man has been banned from all Dutch casinos after he hit on a blackjack dealer. The man, who has not been named, is said to have repeatedly propositioned the dealer despite being repeatedly rejected.</p>

<p>According to local media, the casino staff eventually had to escort the man from the premises after he became increasingly aggressive in his pursuit of the dealer.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that this particular casino has had to deal with an incident like this. Last year, a man was banned for life after he groped a female dealer.</p>

<p>Casino bosses in the Netherlands say that they take such behaviour very seriously and that anyone caught harassing staff will be immediately ejected from the premises.</p>

<h1 id="Court-orders-Dutch-casino-to-pay-woman-€10-000-for-being-hit-on-by-blackjack-dealer"><a href="#Court-orders-Dutch-casino-to-pay-woman-€10-000-for-being-hit-on-by-blackjack-dealer" class="headerlink" title="Court orders Dutch casino to pay woman €10,000 for being hit on by blackjack dealer"></a>Court orders Dutch casino to pay woman €10,000 for being hit on by blackjack dealer</h1><p>A Dutch woman was awarded €10,000 by a court after she was hit on by a blackjack dealer. The woman, who is in her 30s, said she was repeatedly harassed at the casino, with the dealer making comments about her looks and asking for her number.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the casino was partially responsible for the harassment, as it had failed to take steps to prevent it. It ordered the casino to pay the woman €10,000 in compensation for the emotional distress she suffered.</p>
<p>This ruling sets a precedent for other women who may have been harassed at casinos. It sends a clear message that casinos must take steps to prevent this kind of behaviour, and that they will be held liable if it does occur.</p>

<p>The woman, who has not been identified, filed a lawsuit against the Dutch casino after she says the dealer hit her on the head with a blackjack card while trying to clear a crowd of players from the table.</p>
<p>The woman was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital following the incident.</p>
<p>In court, the casino argued that it could not be held liable for the actions of its employees, but the presiding judge ruled that the casino was required to take appropriate safety measures to protect its patrons.</p>
<p>“This ruling makes it clear that casinos have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their guests,” said the woman’s lawyer.</p>

The employee allegedly offered to help the players win in exchange for sexual favors.</p>
<p>The fine was handed down by the Spanish gaming commission, which said that the casino had failed to properly supervise its employees. The commission also warned the casino that it could face further penalties if it is found to have breached gaming regulations in the future.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the casino said that the employee had been fired and that the casino was cooperating with the authorities.</p>
