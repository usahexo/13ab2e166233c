# What is ISoftBet?

ISoftBet is a gaming software company that provides online casino games, sports betting, and live dealer solutions to the online gaming market. The company has a portfolio of more than 100 games in its library, including slots, table games, and video poker variants. ISoftBet also supports a Live Casino offering that allows players to experience casino games with real dealers.

The company was founded in 2010 by two entrepreneurs, Ralph Simon and Asaf Stempler. Both Simon and Stempler had extensive experience in the iGaming industry and brought this knowledge to ISoftBet.
