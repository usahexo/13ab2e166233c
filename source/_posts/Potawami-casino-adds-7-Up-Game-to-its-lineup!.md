#  Potawami casino adds 7-Up Game to its lineup!
Mentioned in the previous Potawami casino article, they are now introducing the 7-Up Game to their players. This game will be a mix between the slot machines and blackjack tables. 
Players can expect to find this new game in the high limit area of the casino. With a minimum bet of $10 and $5 increments, players can expect a thrilling experience that is also rewarding.
The objective of the game is to achieve a hand value of 21 or less without going over, similar to blackjack. However, unlike blackjack, players are dealt two cards face up and one card face down. The player must decide whether to hit or stand on both cards before revealing the third card. 
If the player's hand is lower than 21, they can hit again and receive another card to add to their total hand value. If they bust (go over 21), they lose regardless of the dealer's hand value. 
In order for dealers to win, they must have a hand value of 22 or more after taking into account all cards drawn. In addition, dealers must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. 
As with all games at Potawami casino, there is a chance to win big payouts! So come try your luck at this new and exciting game today!
