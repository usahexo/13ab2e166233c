#  Legalizing Online Gambling Could Create $8.5 Billion in Annual Revenue

A new study by the London-based gambling market research firm H2 Gambling Capital estimates that, if online gambling were legalized throughout the United States, it could create up to $8.5 billion in annual revenue.

The research found that legalizing online betting everywhere – not just in the states which have already done so – would result in a surge in the overall gambling market from $41.9 billion this year to $50.4 billion by 2021. The lion’s share of this growth would come from legalizing online poker and casino games, which are currently banned in most states.

H2 Gambling Capital director Tim Reardon said that the figures showed there was “considerable potential upside” for the US gambling industry if lawmakers embraced legalization. However, he cautioned that there were still many barriers to overcome before this could happen, including resistance from powerful lobbyists such as Sheldon Adelson who oppose any form of legalized gambling.

If online gambling is legalized throughout the United States, it could create up to $8.5 billion in annual revenue.

Advocates of online gambling argue that it is no different from other forms of entertainment such as movies or video games, and should be treated in a similar way under the law. They also point out that it can be a more safe and secure way to gamble than doing so in person at a casino or other physical location.

Opponents of legalization, such as casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, argue that it is immoral and can lead to addiction and other social ills. They also claim that it can be used by criminals to launder money and commit other crimes.

So far only three states – New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada – have fully legalized online gambling, but many others have introduced smaller-scale measures such as allowing residents to bet on horse races or play poker on their smartphones.

#  Legalizing Online Gambling Could Save the States $3 Billion in Taxes

As the US economy slowly rebounds from the Great Recession of 2007-2009, state governments are looking for new sources of revenue to fill budget gaps. Legalizing and regulating online gambling could provide a significant boost to state coffers, generating an estimated $3 billion in tax revenue over the next decade.

Online gambling is currently legal in only a handful of states, mostly due to ambiguous laws and a lack of regulatory infrastructure. However, this is beginning to change, as states search for new ways to generate tax revenue. In October 2013, New Jersey became the first state to legalize online gambling, and several other states are considering similar measures.

By legalizing and regulating online gambling, states can capture a slice of the $30 billion that Americans already spend annually on online gaming. This would provide a steady stream of revenue that could help offset austerity measures and budget cuts. In addition, it would create jobs in the gaming industry and support local businesses.

There are some risks associated with legalizing online gambling, but these can be managed with careful regulation. For example, there is a risk that minors could gamble online or that gamblers could become addicted to gambling. However, these risks can be mitigated by requiring players to be over 21 years of age and by implementing responsible gaming measures.

Online gambling offers a number of advantages over traditional forms of gambling such as casinos and lotteries. It is more convenient and allows players to bet on sporting events and horses from the comfort of their own homes. In addition, online casinos offer better odds than traditional casinos and often have bigger jackpots.

Legalizing online gambling is a win-win proposition for states and their citizens. It would provide much-needed revenue while creating jobs and supporting local businesses. It is time for state governments to embrace this innovative form of taxation and regulation and bring economic relief to their citizens.

#  Legalizing Online Gambling Would Create Thousands of Jobs

The legal online gambling market is booming. In the United States, it is expected to grow from $4.7 billion in 2017 to $11.9 billion by 2020, according to research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC.

This dramatic growth is being driven by the desire of consumers for more convenient and exciting ways to gamble. They can now do so on their phones, computers, and other devices from anywhere in the world.

Legalizing online gambling would create thousands of jobs in the United States. It would also generate significant tax revenue for state and local governments.

Conservative estimates show that legalizing online gambling would create at least 10,000 new jobs in the United States. This includes jobs in areas such as technology, marketing, and customer service.

Job growth would be even higher if online poker were legalized. The Poker Players Alliance (PPA) estimates that legalization would create 30,000 new jobs. These include roles such as dealer, croupier, and pit boss.

The potential for job growth is huge because the online gambling market is still in its early stages of development. If it continues to grow at its current rate, the number of jobs created could easily exceed 50,000 over time.

 tax revenue generated by legal online gambling would be a boon to state and local governments across the United States. In Nevada, for example, taxes and fees from legal gambling totaled $1.3 billion in 2016. This was enough to cover 20% of the state’s budget deficit.

State and local governments are facing increasing budget pressures as a result of rising healthcare costs and pension obligations. Legalizing online gambling would provide much-needed additional revenue to help address these challenges.

#  Legalizing Online Gambling Could Help Address the Budget Deficit

The potential legalization of online gambling in the United States could provide a much needed budgetary boost, according to a recent analysis by the Ohio State University.

The study found that legalizing online gambling could bring in as much as $5.6 billion in new revenue to federal and state governments over the next 10 years. This could help address the budget deficits that many states are currently facing.

The study also found that legalizing online gambling would create thousands of jobs across the country and generate billions of dollars in economic output.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for some gamblers. However, the study found that such risks are manageable and can be mitigated through strong regulation and consumer protection measures.

Despite these benefits, it is unlikely that Congress will legalize online gambling in the near future. However, with many states facing severe budget problems, the prospects for legalization may improve over time.

#  New Study Shows that Legalizing Online Gambling WouldCreate Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Additional Revenue

A recent study conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst has shown that legalizing online gambling would create hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue for the government.

The study, which was funded in part by the American Gaming Association, analyzed data from more than 150 countries around the world. It found that when gambling is legalized and regulated, it generates significant tax revenue and creates jobs.

“This report provides clear evidence that regulating gaming can produce substantial benefits for governments and their citizens,” said Geoff Freeman, President and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “We urge all jurisdictions considering legalization to read and consider its findings.”

According to the study, if online gambling were legalized in the United States, it would generate an additional $270 million in tax revenue each year. This money could be used to fund education, infrastructure projects, or other important initiatives.

In addition to generating tax revenue, legalizing online gambling would also create jobs. The study found that if online gambling were legalized in the United States, it would create over 28,000 new jobs. These jobs would include everything from customer service representatives to software developers.

So far, only a handful of states have legalized online gambling. In 2013, New Jersey became the first state to do so. Other states that have followed suit include Delaware, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.

Despite being legal in a few states, online gambling is still largely illegal nationwide. This is due to a 2006 law known as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). The UIGEA made it illegal for financial institutions to process payments for online gambling transactions.

However, there has been talk recently of repealing the UIGEA. Last year, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced legislation called the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA). The RAWA would make all forms of online gambling illegal nationwide.

The RAWA has been met with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. Many people feel that it is unnecessary and that current laws are sufficient enough to protect consumers.
