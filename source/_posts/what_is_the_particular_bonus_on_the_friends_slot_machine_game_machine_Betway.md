# What is the Bonus on the Friends Slot Machine?

If you are a fan of the iconic TV series Friends, then you will surely enjoy playing the Friends slot machine. Developed by Bally Technologies, the Friends slot machine is a 5-reel game that features images of the show's main characters, including Joey, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe. But what makes this slot machine stand out is its exciting bonus round that can give you the chance to win big.

The Friends slot machine has a few different bonus rounds, but the most exciting one is the Wheel Bonus. To activate this bonus, you need to land three or more wheel bonus symbols on the reels. Once you trigger the bonus, you will be taken to a screen where you will spin a wheel to determine your prize.

The Wheel Bonus has three different wheels: the Letter Board, the Multiplier, and the Friends wheel. The Letter Board wheel is the first one that you will spin, and it will determine the number of picks that you get for the next wheel. The Multiplier wheel will determine the multiplier that you get for your winnings, while the Friends wheel will determine which of the characters' bonuses you will receive.

Each character has its own unique bonus. For example, if you land on Ross's bonus, you will be taken to a screen where you will select different museum artifacts to reveal cash prizes. If you land on Phoebe's bonus, you will be taken to a screen where you will select guitar strings to reveal multipliers. And if you land on Monica's bonus, you will be taken to a screen where you will select plates to reveal different prizes.

The Friends slot machine is a fun and exciting game that offers players the chance to win big. With its entertaining bonus rounds and the chance to see your favorite characters from the show, it's no wonder that this slot machine is so popular. So if you're a Friends fan, be sure to give this game a spin the next time you're at a casino!
