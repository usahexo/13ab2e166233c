#  Everything You Need to Know About Indian Casino Licensing

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988 provides a regulatory scheme for the establishment and operation of Indian casinos on tribal lands. The law establishes three classes of games: 1) Class I games such as bingo, pull tabs, and card games played for minimal prizes; 2) Class II games such as casino-style gaming using slot machines, blackjack, and other table games; 3) Class III games such as full-blown casino gaming.

Tribes may operate class I and class II games without a license from the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). To operate a class III game, a tribe must have a license from the NIGC. Only licensed tribes may offer class III gaming to the public. The law also allows states to enter into compacts with tribes to authorize class III gaming on tribal lands within their borders.

To obtain a compact with a state, a tribe must first pass an ordinance authorizing class III gaming. The tribe must then submit the ordinance to the state governor for approval. Once approved, the tribe may submit the ordinance to the NIGC for certification. The NIGC will also certify any amended or new ordinances submitted by a tribe during the term of its compact.

Compacts are not required for class I or class II gaming. However, if a tribe elects to conduct class III gaming without a compact, it must do so in accordance with IGRA and its implementing regulations. In addition, if a state permits any form of gambling that is not specifically authorized by IGRA (e.g., state lottery or parimutuel wagering), then that state is precluded from entering into compacts with tribes regarding Indian casino gaming.

States are not required to negotiate compacts with tribes seeking to conduct class III gaming. If a state decides not to negotiate, or fails to reach an agreement with a tribe after good faith negotiations, the tribe may petition the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for judicial review. If the court finds that the state has failed to negotiate in good faith, it will order the state to enter into negotiations with the tribe. The court may also order the state to pay attorney's fees and costs incurred by the tribe in connection with its attempts to negotiate a compact.

Tribes wishing to offer Class III gaming must follow several procedures in order receive licensing from NIGC: 

1) Pass an Ordinance - First and foremost is passing an ordinance authorizing class III gaming within your tribal jurisdiction 
2) Submit Request - Submit request including your ordinance governing Class III Gaming mentioning what type of games you’re looking too operate  
3) Receives Certification - Your request will be reviewed by our staff and you will either be granted or denied certification  
4) Negotiate Compacts - After certification is granted many tribes then proceed onto negotiating compacts with states they reside near
