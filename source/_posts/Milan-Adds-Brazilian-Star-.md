#  Milan Adds Brazilian Star 

A week ago, Milan made a big announcement in the soccer world by signing Brazilian superstar, Neymar Jr. This signing makes Neymar the most expensive player in history and Milan one of the biggest clubs in Europe.

This move is huge for Milan as they look to rebound from a disappointing season last year. Neymar brings with him plenty of experience, having played in some of Europe’s top leagues and tournaments. He has won multiple team and individual honors, including being named FIFA World Player of the Year in 2017.

Neymar is expected to bring excitement to Serie A and help lead Milan back to glory. His presence should also make them more competitive in Europe, where they have struggled in recent years.

Milan’s fans are eagerly awaiting the start of the new season and to see their new star in action. They are hoping that Neymar can help lead them to championships and bring some much-needed glory back to their club.

#  Milan Loses Key Player to Injury  

Milan will be looking to replace Nikola Kalinic who is set to miss the next few weeks with an ankle injury. 

Kalinc left the field in tears on Saturday after x-rays confirmed he had broken his ankle and would be out for up to six weeks. 

The 28 year old forward has been in good form this season, scoring 6 goals in 16 appearances. 

Milan manager Gennaro Gattuso will now have to decide who to bring in as a replacement.


There are a few possible candidates, but the most likely option seems to be Fabio Borini. The former Sunderland striker has been out of favour at Milan this season and has only made 5 appearances. However, he does have experience of playing in the Serie A and could be a decent option for Gattuso. 

Another possible option is Patrick Cutrone. The 20 year old has impressed for Milan this season, scoring 7 goals in 18 appearances. He could provide some much needed firepower up front for the Rossoneri. 

Whoever Gattuso decides to bring in, they will have big shoes to fill as Nikola Kalinic has been one of Milan's best players this season.

#  Rossoneri Pick Up a Big Win in Derby Match 

Milan were looking to get back on track and put their disappointing draw against Parma behind them as they faced Inter in the Milan derby. Goals from Suso and Biglia were enough to seal all three points for the Rossoneri, who now find themselves up in fifth place in Serie A.

It was a tight affair in the first half, with both sides creating chances but failing to find the back of the net. The breakthrough finally arrived in the second half, when Suso fired past Samir Handanovic from close range after a well-worked move involving Higuain and Calhanoglu. The goal visibly lifted Milan, who continued to push for a second, and they eventually got it through Biglia’s thunderous strike into the top corner from outside the area.

There was still time for Inter to pull one back, but Milan held on for a deserved victory that takes them above their city rivals in the table. Gattuso will be pleased with how his side bounced back from their previous poor performance, and they will be looking to build on this win as they continue their quest for Champions League qualification.

#  International Break Causes Concern for AC Milan Fans 

The international break is always a time of concern for football fans. This is especially true for AC Milan supporters, who have seen their club go through some tough times in recent years. 

The Rossoneri are currently in seventh place in the Serie A table, and they are just four points above the relegation zone. Things could get even worse for them during the international break, as several key players could be absent for crucial fixtures. 

Milan’s captain, Alessio Romagnoli, is one of those players who could be missing due to injury. The 23-year-old defender suffered a calf injury during Italy’s match against Poland last week, and it is currently unknown how long he will be out for. 

Another player who is likely to miss time due to injury is goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The 19-year-old shot-stopper picked up a muscle strain during Italy’s match against Spain earlier this month, and he is expected to be out of action for at least two weeks. 

These injuries are a major blow to AC Milan, as they prepare for important fixtures against Genoa and Inter Milan. If Romagnoli and Donnarumma are both unavailable for these matches, it will be very difficult for the team to get positive results. 

AC Milan supporters will hope that the rest of the team can step up in these matches and get some much-needed points on the board.

#  Is Milan's Struggling Season Behind Them?

Milan have had a difficult season so far, making it through to the Europa League knockout stages but not doing well in Serie A. 

There were high hopes for the team this year after they made some big signings during the summer transfer window. But things didn't go as planned and they have been struggling to find consistency.

In their last six games in all competitions, they have only won one and that was against Ludogorets in the Europa League. They also drew one and lost four. This poor form has seen them slip down to seventh place in Serie A, ten points behind leaders Juventus. 

Many people have been questioning whether or not Milan's poor season is behind them now that they have reached the Europa League knockout stages. They will be facing Arsenal in the next round and it will be a tough tie for them. 

Arsenal are one of the strongest teams in Europe and Milan will have to be at their best if they want to progress. If they don't manage to win this tie then their poor season is likely to continue.
