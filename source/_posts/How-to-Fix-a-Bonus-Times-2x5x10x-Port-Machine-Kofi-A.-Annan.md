#  How to Troubleshoot a Bonus Times 2x5x10x Port Machine Kofi A. Annan

This article is about how to troubleshoot a Bonus Times 2x5x10x port machine. 

First, make sure that the machine is turned on and plugged in. If it is not, turn it on and plug it in. Once you have verified that the machine is turned on and plugged in, check to see if the power cord is securely plugged into the outlet. If it is not, plug it in securely.

Once you have verified that the power cord is plugged in securely, check to see if the outlet works by plugging something else into it. If the other thing plugs in and works, then the outlet works. If the other thing does not plug in or does not work, then the outlet does not work. In this case, you will need to find another outlet to plug the machine into.

If you have determined that both the machine and the outlet are working properly, check to see if there is anything blocking the machine from running properly. Make sure that there are no items obstructing the fans or vents on the machine. If there are items obstructing the fans or vents, move them so that air can flow freely through the machine.

If you have checked to see that everything is plugged in correctly and there are no items obstructing airflow, and the machine still will not turn on, then you may need to call technical support. They can help you troubleshoot further to determine why the machine is not working properly
