#  Casino gap boss enjoys salary of $420,000

A recent study has revealed that the casino gap boss’s salary is a whopping $420,000. This revelation has caused outrage throughout the casino industry, as employees struggle to make ends meet on their measly wages.

One casino worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s disgraceful. The gap boss earns more in a week than we do in a year. How can we be expected to live on this kind of money?”

The study also found that the average gap boss earns almost five times more than the average casino employee. This yawning pay differential has been blamed for the high staff turnover rates in the industry.

Many casino employees have quit their jobs in frustration, choosing instead to work in lower-paying industries where they can at least afford to live. Others have resorted to taking out expensive loans in order to make ends meet.

The gap boss himself was tight-lipped when approached for comment, simply saying that he was “happy with his salary”. However, he refused to reveal how much he actually earns.

This latest revelation is likely to add fuel to the fire of the ongoing debate about income inequality in America. It seems that while the wealthy are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. And there doesn’t seem to be anything anyone can do about it.
